# Weather Prediction

A modular machine learning project to **predict weather conditions** based on multiple meteorological features. It includes complete data pipelines, model training with MLflow tracking, and a user-friendly Flask web app to input data and get predictions.

---

## Overview

This project uses real-time weather data from the **Open-Meteo API** to build a predictive model for weather conditions. It emphasizes clean architecture through modular pipelines: 
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**
- **Model training and evaluation**
- **Prediction API**

The web interface allows users to submit key environmental variables and view predictions instantly.

## Key Features

- **Data Ingestion** from Open-Meteo API
- **Data Preprocessing**: handle missing values, remove duplicates, and feature engineering
- **Train-Test Splitting** for model validation
- **Model Training and Evaluation** with MLflow logging
- **Prediction Pipeline** for real-time inference
- **Flask Web App** with HTML/CSS UI and REST API
- **Modular Programming** for better structure and reusability
